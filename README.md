Traffic Sign Recognition using skimage, cv2, and Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a system capable of recognizing traffic signs through the implementation of computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. Traffic sign recognition is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). By accurately detecting and interpreting traffic signs, vehicles can better understand their environment, enhance safety, and facilitate efficient navigation.
